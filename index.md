# Description

For synchronous networks, in this project we show that in order to achieve
energy efficiency, we need best-case optimal protocols. In order to solve the
SMR problem, we design E2C protocol, that is more efficient and best-case
optimal than the state-of-the-art SMR protocol Sync HotStuff. We do this by
observing that the certificates generated for every block are needed only during
the view change. We therefore mark blocks and generate certificates on demand.
We also show how to leverage multicasts when available in the system to improve
the energy efficiency.
